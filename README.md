# CMPUT404 CGI Experiments

Experimenting with CGI server stuff!

Note that all code except hello.py originated from the lab repository from which this project was forked, or from instructions with the TAs during the lab lecture. The hello.py file contains my own code created by following the lab instructions at https://uofa-cmput404.github.io/lab-3-common-gateway-interface.html and searching through the cgi documentation provided at https://docs.python.org/3/library/cgi.html
